# ViewModelExample

A ViewModel in Android is a component of the Android Architecture Components library that is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner. It is specifically used to handle the data and business logic for a particular UI component, such as an Activity or Fragment, and survives configuration changes (e.g., screen rotation) without losing its data.

The primary purpose of a ViewModel is to separate the UI-related data and logic from the UI components themselves, such as Activities and Fragments. By doing so, ViewModels help in implementing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and improves code maintainability and testability.
